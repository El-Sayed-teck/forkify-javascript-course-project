# forkify Project

Recipe application with custom recipe upload.

Credits:

This project is based on the Forkify application from The Complete JavaScript Course by Jonas Schmedtmann.

• Original HTML and Sass were created by Jonas Schmedtmann

• JavaScript structure and features were built by me while following the course, with additional debugging and deployment work done independently

This project is used here for educational and portfolio purposes.

My Contributions:

• Implemented full MVC architecture in JavaScript

• Integrated API calls and state management

• Deployed the application
